  <p class="lead">A front-end framework is a standardized set of guidelines, styles, and interactive components which help streamline web and app development. It provides front-end developers with a faster and easier way to build consistent, scalable user interfaces.</p>

  <p>Front-end frameworks come packaged in a folder structure with codebase files usually comprised of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Some may come with a simple grid system built using only HTML/CSS while others include more advanced development languages such as jquery and Sass.</p>

  <p>I developed this site using <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a> which is one of the most famous open-source and well-documented mobile first frameworks currently available. It includes an added flexbox grid system, a variety of components to help solve complex design issues and prebuilt templates to get you quickly started.</p>

  <p>There are many front-end frameworks with each having their advantages and disadvantages. I found it best to pick a few, thoroughly review and compare then decide on the most suitable for my needs. Here are a few I recommend.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://materializecss.com/" target="_blank">Materialize</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb Foundation</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank">Skeleton</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://getuikit.com/" target="_blank">uikit</a></li>
  </ul>
