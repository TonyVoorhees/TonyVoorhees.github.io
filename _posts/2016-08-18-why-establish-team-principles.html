  <p class="lead">Establishing principles can give your team a significant advantage by clarifying common goals, structuring methods, and delivering the ideal product or experience. They can be the underlying factors that make some teams more successful than others.</p>

  <p>Here are a few reasons why a team should develop a set of principles:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Principles provide teams with guidance at all phases of production from initial concepts to a deployed product</li>
    <li>Principles bring individual perspectives together building trust and stronger bonds between team members</li>
    <li>Principles give team members confidence to make the tough decisions with reasons that are understood and accepted</li>
    <li>Principles help teams form proper workflows streamlining production to bring products and services faster to market</li>
    <li>Principles create a more open culture giving teams a foundation to learn from and grow as projects progress</li>
    <li>Principles build respect from inside an organization retaining loyal members while onboarding new talent</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A set of team principles should not be followed like rules but a guiding vision for members to understand one another while working together. They should express expectations and insights about the team's primary objectives as well as their goals.</p>

  <p>When developing principles, it's best to involve all members to share and take part. Giving them the opportunity to contribute to the process will bring members closer and directly affect how the team upholds the principles.</p>

  <p>Keep in mind principles should be flexible and adapt as a team grows. Checking the team's principles against their achievements is an excellent way to keep them relevant and progressive. It also enables teams to gain a larger perspective of their work and how it all relates.</p>

  <p>Having a set of principles can make your team stand out and give them the attitude they need to be more successful. They are worth considering when starting a new team or restructuring an old one.</p>

  <p>If your organization is looking for better performance or just want to make work more satisfying than creating a set of team principles is a great starting point. </p>
