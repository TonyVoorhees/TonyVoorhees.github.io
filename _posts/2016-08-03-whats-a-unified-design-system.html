  <p class="lead">A unified design system is a comprehensive design strategy; that advocates for a more cohesive user experience by establishing a solid foundation of principles, guidelines, best practices, and assets in an easily accessible repository.</p>
  <p>It provides a common language for teams to work with making it easier to collaborate, coordinate, and maintain consistency across multiple products and platforms. It can also help alleviate redundant work and allow people to get quickly up to speed with minimal training.</p>
  <p>Below are a few robust design systems currently being utilized in the marketplace.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.ibm.com/design/language/" target="_blank">IBM Design Language</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://material.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Material Design</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/" target="_blank">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/gel" target="_blank">BBC Global Experience Language</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://harmony.intuit.com/" target="_blank">Harmony Design System by Intuit</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/" target="_blank">Salesforce Lightning Design System</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are drawbacks to creating such extensive systems such as the initial investment and maintenance. Keeping assets organized and up-to-date is a job in itself. Many design-driven businesses that ship multiple products employ designated teams.</p>
  <p>A unified design system is not necessary, but it does offer many advantages to growing companies looking to scale resources and streamline production all while maintaining brand consistency.</p>
