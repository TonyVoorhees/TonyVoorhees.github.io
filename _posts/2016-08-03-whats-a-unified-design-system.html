  <p>A unified design system is a holistic approach to design that advocates for a more cohesive user experience by establishing a solid foundation of principles, guidelines, best practices, and assets in an easily accessible repository. It provides a common language for teams to work with making it easier to collaborate, coordinate, and maintain consistency across multiple products and platforms. It can also help alleviate redundant development work and allow people to get quickly up to speed with minimal training.</p>
